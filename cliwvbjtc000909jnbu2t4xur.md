## Introduction

In this series about nodejs today we are going to learn about file system. The file system module in Node.js is a powerful tool that allows developers to interact with the file system on their machines. It provides a wide range of functions and methods for <mark> creating, reading, updating, and deleting files</mark> and directories. Whether you need to manipulate files, retrieve information about them, or perform other file-related operations, the file system module has got you covered. Throughout this blog, we will cover essential topics such as reading and writing files, creating and deleting directories, working with file permissions, and navigating the file.

## Using the File System modules

The file system comes into play in various scenarios during software development and system administration tasks. Here are some common situations where the file system plays a crucial role:

1. **File I/O Operations**: The file system is primarily used for reading from and writing to files. Whether you need to <mark> read configuration files, log data, or user input, or write output or data files, </mark> the file system module in Node.js provides the necessary functions to perform these operations efficiently.
    
2. **File Manipulatio**n: The file system allows you to manipulate files in numerous ways. You can <mark>create new files, copy or move existing files, rename files, delete files, and modify their content</mark>s. These operations are vital for managing data, organizing file structures, and maintaining file integrity within an application or a system.
    
3. **Directory Management:** The file system is responsible for managing directories or folders. You can <mark> create new directories, rename directories, delete directories, and traverse directory structures to locate specific files</mark> or perform batch operations on multiple files.
    
4. **File Metadata and Information**: The file system provides access to file metadata and information such as file size, permissions, timestamps (creation, modification, and access), ownership details, and file type. Retrieving and manipulating this information is crucial for tasks such as file analysis, permission checks, and auditing.
    
5. **File System Navigation**: The file system allows you to navigate the directory hierarchy, retrieve directory contents, and traverse through nested directories. This capability is essential when you need to <mark> locate specific files, scan directories for certain file types</mark>, or perform recursive operations on directory structures.
    

## Understanding the File System Module

Node.js's fs module provides an interface for performing file-related operations, such as reading from and writing to files, creating and deleting directories, and manipulating file metadata. To utilize the fs module, you need to import it using the `require` keyword.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
```

### Reading Files

To read the contents of a file, you can use the `fs.readFile` method. It takes the file path and an optional encoding parameter as arguments and returns the file contents as a string or a buffer.

```javascript
fs.readFile('path/to/file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```

### Writing Files

To write data to a file, you can use the `fs.writeFile` method. It takes the file path, data to be written, and an optional encoding parameter as arguments. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it already exists, its contents will be overwritten.

```javascript
const data = 'Hello, world!';
fs.writeFile('path/to/file.txt', data, 'utf8', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Data written to file!');
});
```

### Creating Directories

To create a directory, you can use the `fs.mkdir` method. It takes the directory path and an optional options object as arguments. By default, the directory is created with read, write, and execute permissions.

```javascript
fs.mkdir('path/to/new_directory', { recursive: true }, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Directory created!');
});
```

### Deleting Files and Directories

To delete a file, you can use the `fs.unlink` method. It takes the file path as an argument.

```javascript
fs.unlink('path/to/file.txt', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File deleted!');
});
```

To delete an empty directory, you can use the `fs.rmdir` method. It takes the directory path as an argument.

```javascript
fs.rmdir('path/to/empty_directory', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Directory deleted!');
});
```

### File Metadata

You can obtain metadata about a file using the `fs.stat` method. It takes the file path as an argument and returns an object containing information such as file size, permissions, and modification time.

```javascript
fs.stat('path/to/file.txt', (err, stats) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File size:', stats.size);
  console.log('File permissions:', stats.mode);
  console.log('Last modified:', stats.mtime);
});
```

## Conclusion
