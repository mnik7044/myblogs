## Introduction

Hello there! Welcome to the wonderful world of DOM manipulation in JavaScript. Knowing dom is like a superpower by which you get to build and change things in the virtual world of the web, all with just a few lines of code. And let's be honest, who doesn't love making things happen on a webpage?

In this blog, we'll explore the magical powers of JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM), which allows us to interact with and manipulate the elements of a web page. Don't worry if you're new to all this â€“ we'll start with the basics and work our way up to some more advanced techniques. So, get ready to dive into the fascinating world of DOM manipulation!

## Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM)

Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM is an essential part of web development because it allows developers to manipulate web pages dynamically. In this blog, we will learn how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.

<mark>Simply it's accessing HTML elements from javascript.</mark>

Here's an example of a simple HTML document:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>DOM Manipulation</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my blog.</p>
    <button>Click me!</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a hierarchical structure that represents the web page in the browser. Each element in the page is represented as an object in the DOM tree, with its properties and methods. The DOM provides a way for web developers to access and manipulate these objects using JavaScript.

The DOM tree for this HTML document looks like this:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683693334059/2d9704a2-808e-4aa0-980f-33ac5891d2a9.png align="center")

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<html>` tags are not represented in the DOM tree because they are not elements. The `<head>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<button>` tags are all elements in the DOM tree. The `<title>` tag is also an element, but it is nested inside the `<head>` element.

## Accessing Elements in the DOM

Now that we have a basic understanding of the DOM, let's learn how to access elements in the DOM using JavaScript. There are several ways to access elements in the DOM, but the most common way is to use the `document` object, and they are:

### `querySelector` & `querySelectorAll`

The `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` methods allow you to select elements on a web page using CSS-like selectors. These methods are incredibly powerful and flexible, as they allow you to select elements based on a wide range of criteria, such as tag name, class name, ID, attribute value, and more.

Here's an example of how to use `querySelector` to select the first paragraph element on a page and change its font color:

```javascript
let myElement = document.querySelector('p');
myElement.style.color = 'red';
```

And here's an example of how to use `querySelectorAll` to select all paragraph elements on a page and change their font size:

```javascript
let myElements = document.querySelectorAll('p');
for (let i = 0; i < myElements.length; i++) {
  myElements[i].style.fontSize = '20px';
}
```

### `getElementById`

The `getElementById` method allows you to select an element on a web page by its unique ID attribute. This method is particularly useful when you need to select a specific element that has a unique identifier.

Here's an example of how to use `getElementById` to select a paragraph element with the ID "my-paragraph" and change its font family:

```javascript
let myElement = document.getElementById('my-paragraph');
myElement.style.fontFamily = 'Arial';
```

### `getElementsByClassName`

The `getElementsByClassName` method allows you to select elements on a web page by their class names. This method is useful when you need to select multiple elements that share a common class name.

Here's an example of how to use `getElementsByClassName` to select all paragraph elements with the class "my-paragraph-class" and change their font-weight:

```javascript
let myElements = document.getElementsByClassName('my-paragraph-class');
for (let i = 0; i < myElements.length; i++) {
  myElements[i].style.fontWeight = 'bold';
}
```

### `getElementsByTagName`

The `getElementsByTagName` method allows you to select elements on a web page by their tag name. This method is useful when you need to select multiple elements that share a common tag name, such as all `<p>` elements or all `<img>` elements.

Here's an example of how to use `getElementsByTagName` to select all paragraph elements on a page and change their font color:

```javascript
let myElements = document.getElementsByTagName('p');
for (let i = 0; i < myElements.length; i++) {
  myElements[i].style.color = 'blue';
}
```

**<mark>Remember everyone when we are writing document.getElementByID it means that document is an object and getElementById is a method of the object document.</mark>**

## Manipulating Elements in the DOM

Now that we know how to access elements in the DOM, let's learn how to manipulate them, which means how to change those elements according to our convenience. There are several ways to manipulate elements in the DOM, such as changing their content, attributes, styles, and position.

HTML document is structured as a JavaScript Object. Every HTML element has different properties which can help to manipulate it. It is possible to get, create, append, or remove HTML elements using JavaScript.

### Changing Element Content

To change the content of an element, we can simply update its `textContent` or `innerHTML` property. The `textContent` property sets or returns the text content of an element, while the `innerHTML` property sets or returns the HTML content of an element.

Here's an example of how to change the content of the `<h1>` element in our HTML document:

```javascript
h1.textContent = 'Hello, DOM!';
```

In this example, we used the `textContent` property to change the text content of the `<h1>` element to "Hello, DOM!".

Here's an example of how to change the content of the `<p>` element in our HTML document using the `innerHTML` property:

```javascript
const p = document.querySelector('p');
p.innerHTML = 'Welcome to my <em>awesome</em> blog!';
```

In this example, we used the `innerHTML` property to change the HTML content of the `<p>` element to "Welcome to my &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; blog!". The `<em>` tag is used to emphasize the word "awesome".

### Changing Element Attributes

To change the attributes of an element, we can simply update its attribute values using the `setAttribute` method. The `setAttribute` method takes two arguments: the name of the attribute and its new value.

Here's an example of how to change the `src` attribute of an `<img>` element:

```javascript
const img = document.querySelector('img');
img.setAttribute('src', 'path/to/new/image.jpg');
```

In this example, we used the `setAttribute` method to change the `src` attribute of the `<img>` element to "path/to/new/image.jpg".

### Changing Element Styles

To change the styles of an element, we can simply update its style properties using the `style` object. The `style` object contains properties for all the CSS styles that can be applied to an element.

Here's an example of how to change the background color of the `<body>` element:

```javascript
const body = document.body;
body.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
```

In this example, we used the `style` object to set the `backgroundColor` property of the `<body>` element to "red".

### Changing Element Position

To change the position of an element, we can simply update its position properties using the `style` object. The position properties include `position`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.

Here's an example of how to move an element to a new position:

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector('.element');
element.style.position = 'absolute';
element.style.top = '100px';
element.style.left = '100px';
```

In this example, we used the `style` object to set the `position` property of the `.element` element to "absolute", and the `top` and `left` properties to "100px".

### Adding and Removing Elements

To add a new element to the DOM, we can use the `createElement` method to create a new element, and the `appendChild` method to add it to an existing element.

Here's an example of how to add a new `<div>` element to the `<body>` element:

```javascript
const div = document.createElement('div');
div.textContent = 'Hello, world!';
document.body.appendChild(div);
```

  
used the `innerHTML` property to change the HTML content of the `<p>` element to "Welcome to my &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; blog!". The `<em>` tag is used to emphasize the word "awesome".

## Tips

* <mark>Use </mark> `querySelector` <mark> and </mark> `querySelectorAll` <mark> to select elements whenever possible, as they are faster and more efficient than other selection methods.</mark>
    
* Cache DOM element references whenever possible, to avoid repeated lookups and improve performance.
    
* Avoid using inline styles and instead use CSS classes and stylesheets to apply styles to your elements.
    
* <mark>Use </mark> `textContent` <mark> instead of </mark> `innerHTML` <mark> whenever possible, to avoid security risks and improve performance.</mark>
    

By following these best practices and using the techniques and methods we've covered in this blog, you'll be able to create powerful and efficient web applications that make use of the full power of the DOM.

## Conclusion

In this blog, we learned how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript. We learned how to access elements in the DOM using the `document` object, and how to manipulate their content, attributes, styles, and position.

Manipulating the DOM is an essential part of web development, and it allows us to create dynamic and interactive web pages. With the knowledge gained from this blog, you should now be able to create more complex web pages and applications that respond to user input and update dynamically.

Remember to use the right tool for the job, whether that's `querySelector` for specific elements, `getElementById` for unique identifiers, `getElementsByClassName` for groups of elements, or `getElementsByTagName` for selecting elements by tag name. And if all else fails, just start randomly clicking on things until you figure it out (just kidding, please don't do that).

If you're interested in learning more about DOM manipulation, there are many great resources available online, including the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) web docs and various online courses and tutorials.
